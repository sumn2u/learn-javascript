description:  Inheritance refers to the ability of an object (subclass) to inherit properties and methods from another object (superclass). JavaScript supports prototypal inheritance, which means that objects can inherit properties and methods directly from other objects, known as prototypes.

# Inheritance

The inheritance is useful for code reusability purposes as it extends existing properties and methods of a class. The `extends` keyword is used to create a class inheritance. &#x20;

```javascript
class Car {
  constructor(brand) {
    this.carname = brand;
  }
  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.carname;
  }
}

class Model extends Car {
  constructor(brand, mod) {
    super(brand);
    this.model = mod;
  }
  show() {
    return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model;
  }
}

let myCar = new Model("Toyota", "Camry");
console.log(myCar.show()); // I have a Camry, it is a Toyota.
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The prototype of the parent class must be an `Object` or `null`.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

The `super` method is used inside a constructor and refers to the parent class. With this, one can access the parent class properties and methods.
