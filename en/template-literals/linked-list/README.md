# Linked List

It is a common data structure found in all programming languages. A Linked List is very similar to a normal array in Javascript, it just acts a little bit differently.

Here each element in the list is a separate object containing a link or a pointer to the next. There is no built-in method or function for Linked Lists in Javascript so one has to implement it. An example of a linked list is shown below.&#x20;

```
["one", "two", "three", "four"]
```

T**ypes of Linked Lists**

There are three different types of linked lists:

1. **Singly Linked Lists:**  Each node contains only one pointer to the next node.
2. **Doubly Linked Lists:**  There are two pointers at each node, one to the next node and one to the previous node.
3. **Circular Linked Lists:**  A circular linked list forms a loop by having the last node pointing to the first node or any other node before it.
