# Else

There is also an `else` clause that will be applied when the first condition isnâ€™t true. This is very powerful if you want to react to any value, but single out one in particular for special treatment.

```javascript
let umbrellaMandatory;

if (country === "England") {
  umbrellaMandatory = true;
} else {
  umbrellaMandatory = false;
}
```

The `else` clause can be joined with another `if`. Let's remake the example from the previous article.

```javascript
if (country === "England") {
  ...
} else if (country === "France") {
  ...
} else if (country === "Germany") {
  ...
}
```

{% exercise %}
From the following values write a conditional statement that checks if `num1` is greater than `num2`. If it is, assign "num1 is greater than num2" to the `result` variable. If it is not, assign "num1 is less than or equal to num2".

{% initial %}
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;
let result;

// check if num1 is greater than num2
if( condition ) {

}else {

}
{% solution %}
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;
let result;

// check if num1 is greater than num2
if (num1 > num2) {
  result = "num1 is greater than num2";
} else {
  result = "num1 is less than or equal to num2";
}

{% validation %}
assert(result == "num1 is greater than num2" );
