# Chapter 16
# Browser Object Model (BOM)

The browser object model lets us interact with the browser window. The `window` object represents the browser's window and is supported by all browsers.

Object `window` is the default object for a browser, so we can specify `window` or call directly all the functions.

```javascript
window.alert("Welcome to Learn JavaScript");  

alert("Welcome to Learn JavaScript")
```

In a similar fashion, we can call other properties underneath the window object such as history, screen, navigator, location, and so on.
