# Intermediate Level JavaScript Interview Questions
## 1. Loops
### 1.1. What is the definition of an iteration in a JavaScript loop?

**Answer:**

An iteration in a JavaScript loop refers to each individual execution of the loop's body, typically corresponding to one cycle of the loop.

### 1.2. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?

**Answer:**

While loop: A while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement.

For loop: A for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping.

Do while: A do-while loop is similar to while loop with the only difference that it checks the condition after executing the statements, and therefore is an example of Exit Control Loop.

### 1.3. How does the break statement work in a loop?

**Answer:**

The break statement terminates the current loop or switch statement and transfers program control to the statement following the terminated statement. It can also be used to jump past a labeled statement when used within that labeled statement.

### 1.4. How does the continue statement work in a loop?

**Answer:**

 The continue directive is a "lighter version" of the break statement. It does not stop the whole loop; instead, it stops the current iteration and forces the loop to start a new one (if the condition allows).
