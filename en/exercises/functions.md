# Functions

A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task and executed when "something" invokes it. More info about functions can be found in the[ functions](../functions/) chapter.

### 📝 Task:

- [ ] Write a program to create a function named `isOdd`that passes a number `45345` as an argument and determines whether the number is odd or not.

- [ ] Call this function to get the result. The result should be in a boolean format and should return `true` in `console`.&#x20;

- [ ] Write a program to create a function named `calculateRectangleArea` that takes two parameters `width` and `height` of the rectange and should return `area` of the rectangle.

### 💡 Hints:

- Visit the [functions](../functions/) chapter to understand functions and how to create them.
