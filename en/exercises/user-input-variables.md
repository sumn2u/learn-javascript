# User Input Variables

In JavaScript, we can take input from users and use it as a variable. One doesn't need to know their value to work with them.

### 📝 Tasks:

* [ ] Write a program to take input from a user and add `10` to it, and print its result.

### 💡 Hints:

* The content of a variable is determined by the user's inputs. The `prompt()` method saves the input value as a string.
* You will need to make sure that the string value is converted into an integer for calculations.&#x20;
* Visit the [Basic Operators](../numbers/operators.md) chapter for the type conversion of `string` to `int`.&#x20;
