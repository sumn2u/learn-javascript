# Constants

Constants were introduced in ES6(2015), and use a `const` keyword. Variables that are declared with `const` cannot be reassigned or redeclared.&#x20;

### Example:

```javascript
const VERSION = '1.2';
```

### 📝 Task:

* [ ] Run the program mentioned below and fix the error that you see in the console. Make sure that the code result is `0.9` when it is fixed in the console.

```javascript
const VERSION = '0.7';
VERSION = '0.9';
console.log(VERSION);
```

### 💡 Hints:

* Visit the  [Variables](../basics/variables.md) chapter for more info about const and also look for "_TypeError assignment to constant variable_" in search engines to learn a fix.&#x20;
