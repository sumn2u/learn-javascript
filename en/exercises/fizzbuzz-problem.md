# FizzBuzz Problem

The _FizzBuzz_ problem is one of the commonly asked questions, here one has to print _Fizz_ and _Buzz_ upon some conditions.

### üìù Tasks:

* [ ] Write a program to print all the numbers between 1 to 100 in such a way that the following conditions are met.
  * For multiples of 3, instead of the number, print `Fizz`.
  * For multiples of 5, print `Buzz`.
  * For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print `FizzBuzz`.

    ```javascript
    /
    1  
    2  
    Fizz  
    4  
    Buzz  
    Fizz
