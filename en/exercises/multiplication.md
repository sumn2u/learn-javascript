# Multiplication

In JavaScript, we can perform the multiplication of two numbers by using the asterisk `(*)` arithmetic operators.&#x20;

### Example:

```javascript
let resultingValue = 3 * 2;
```

Here, we stored the product of `3 * 2` into a `resultingValue` variable.

### 📝 Tasks:

- [ ] Write a program to store the product of `23` times `41` and print its value.

- [ ] Write a program that generates a multiplication table for a specific number. The program should take a number as input and then display the multiplication table for that number, from 1 to 10.

### 💡 Hints:

- Visit the [Basic Operators](../numbers/operators.md) chapter to understand the mathematical operations.
