## üìö Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

**Learn JavaScript: Beginners Guide** provides a foundational understanding of programming and JavaScript. It covers the core concepts in a simple and organized manner, offering in-depth information and notes along with examples to facilitate comprehension. Each chapter includes exercises to reinforce your learning.

**What You'll Learn**

This book is designed for both novice and experienced programmers, offering a comprehensive introduction to the JavaScript programming language. It's divided into three main parts. The initial 14 chapters focus on JavaScript fundamentals, while the subsequent four chapters delve into web browser programming using JavaScript. The last two chapters are dedicated to miscellaneous topics and exercises.

**üöÄ Code, and What to Do With It**

Code is the heart of any program, and this book contains numerous code examples. To master programming, it's essential to read and write code diligently. Don't rush through the examples; take your time to understand them thoroughly. The same applies to the exercises ‚Äì attempt to solve them before checking the solutions. Consider running your code in a JavaScript interpreter to ensure it works correctly. Experimenting and going beyond the exercises will enhance your skills.

By adding emojis and organizing the content, you can make the text more engaging and visually appealing.

## Typographic conventions

In this book, text written in a monospaced font represents elements of a program. This can be a self-contained fragment or a reference to part of a nearby program. Programs, like the one shown below, are written in this way:

```javascript
const numbers = [45, 4, 9, 16, 25];
let txt = "";
for (let x in numbers) {
  txt += numbers[x];
}
```

Sometimes, the expected output of a program is written after it, preceded by two slashes with a _Result_, like this:

```javascript
console.log(txt);

// Result: txt = '45491625'
```
