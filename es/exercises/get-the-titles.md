# Get the Titles!

The _Get the Titles!_ problem is an interesting problem where we have to get the title from a list of books. This is a good exercise for the implementation of arrays and objects.

### 📝 Tasks:

Given an array of objects that represent books with an author.

```javascript
const books = [
  {
    title: "Eloquent JavaScript, Third Edition",
    author: "Marijn Haverbeke"
  },
  {
    title: "Practical Modern JavaScript",
    author: "Nicolás Bevacqua"
  }
]
```

* [ ] Write a program to create a function `getTheTitles` that takes the array and returns the array of title and print its value in the `console`.

### 💡 Hints:

* Visit the [arrays](../arrays/) and [objects](../objects/) chapter to understand how the array and object work.
