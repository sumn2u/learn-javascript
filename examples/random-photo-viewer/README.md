# 📸 Random Photo Viewer

A simple and fun JavaScript project that displays a random image every time you click a button.

## 🔍 Concepts Demonstrated
- Arrays and random selection in JavaScript
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- CSS transitions for smooth effects

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Images are stored in an array.
2. Each time the button is clicked, a random index is chosen.
3. The image source is updated, and a fade transition is applied.

## 🧩 Bonus Idea
You can replace the local array with an API like Unsplash to load new random images dynamically.
